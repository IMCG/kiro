Requirements 
============

kiro requires CMake and pkg-config for building libraries and accompanying
tools. Information about CMake can be found at:

    http://www.cmake.org

and pkg-config at:

        http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig

kiro depends on the GObject library for object oriented programming.
Information about this library can be found at:

        http://developers.gnome.org/gobject/stable


Building the Library
====================

On Linux, kiro uses the CMake build system and
pkg-config for dependency detection. The normal
procedure to build this library is to create an
empty build directory:

    $ mkdir build/ && cd build

configure the project using CMake:

    $ cmake ../

and compiling the library with make:

    $ make $ make install

Options to the build process can
be passed to the system when
configuring:

    $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

or via configuration tools like `ccmake`.
